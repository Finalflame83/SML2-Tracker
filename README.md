# Template Pack for PopTracker

This is my first attempt at making a poptracker pack.  While Super Mario Land 2 doesn't have much to track, it can be useful to know if you have more checks open without constantly booting up the game and manually checking each level.  To start with, this pack may not have much funcionality, but I will be adding as I see fit and am capable.

Currently this tracker works with manual tracking.  I have added support for shuffled pipe traversals, however, if you are not playing with this setting enabled, currently you must manually marked all of the pipe traversal items in order for the tracker to work properly.
